// Script to regenerate attendance data with correct Sunday handling
console.log("Regenerating attendance data to fix Sunday issues...\n");

// This script demonstrates how to regenerate attendance data
// In a real application, you would run this to refresh the data

const instructions = `
To fix existing attendance data with incorrect Sunday entries:

1. The AttendanceProvider has been updated with the following fixes:
   - Sundays are now always marked as "Holiday" (Priority 1)
   - Public holidays are always marked as "Holiday" (Priority 2)
   - Leave requests are only applied to working days (Priority 3)

2. The addAttendance() function now validates:
   - Prevents marking Sundays as "Leave"
   - Prevents marking public holidays as "Leave"
   - Auto-corrects status to "Holiday" for Sundays and public holidays

3. The editAttendance() function now validates:
   - Prevents editing Sundays to "Leave" status
   - Prevents editing public holidays to "Leave" status
   - Auto-corrects status to "Holiday" for Sundays and public holidays

4. To refresh existing data:
   - The attendance data is regenerated when the component mounts
   - Any manual attendance entries will now be validated
   - The calendar view will show correct statuses

Key Changes Made:
- Updated AttendanceProvider.jsx with validation logic
- Added getDayOfWeek() validation in addAttendance()
- Added getDayOfWeek() validation in editAttendance()
- Sundays (dayOfWeek === 0) are now protected from being marked as "Leave"

The issue where "Leave" was showing on Sundays in the calendar view has been resolved.
