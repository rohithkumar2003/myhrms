### Holiday Verification Results
- âœ… **Total holidays**: 72 (20 regular + 52 Sundays)

- âœ… **Sunday inclusion**: All 52 Sundays of 2025 included
- âœ… **Strategic holidays**: All 5 strategic holidays properly configured

## ðŸ“Š Sandwich Leave Logic

The sandwich leave calculation works as follows:

1. **Definition**: A sandwich leave occurs when an employee takes leave on both the day before AND the day after a holiday
2. **Detection**: The system checks all holidays and verifies if there are approved leaves on both adjacent days
3. **Counting**: Each holiday that has leaves on both sides counts as +1 sandwich leave
4. **Reporting**: The system provides detailed breakdowns showing:
   - Which holidays triggered sandwich leaves
   - The specific leave dates before and after each holiday
   - Total count per employee

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
```javascript
// Holiday structure with unique IDs
{
  id: 1000,           // Unique ID (1000+ for Sundays, 1-20 for regular)
  name: "Sunday",     // Holiday name
  date: "2025-01-05", // Date in YYYY-MM-DD format
  description: "Weekly holiday - Sunday",
  isSunday: true      // Flag for Sunday holidays
}

// Sandwich leave details structure
{
  count: 1,           // Total sandwich leave count
  dates: ["2025-07-13"], // Array of sandwich leave dates
  details: [{         // Detailed breakdown
    holidayDate: "2025-07-13",
    leaveBefore: "2025-07-12",
    leaveAfter: "2025-07-14"
  }]
}
```

### Context Integration
The sandwich leave functionality is fully integrated with:
- **EmployeeContext**: Employee data and management
- **LeaveRequestContext**: Leave request data and approvals
- **HolidayCalendarContext**: Holiday calendar with Sundays
- **AttendanceContext**: Attendance tracking and sandwich leave calculations

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage Examples

```

### Get All Employees Summary
```javascript
const { getAllEmployeesSandwichLeaveSummary } = useContext(AttendanceContext);
